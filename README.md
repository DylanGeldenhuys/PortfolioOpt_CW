# PortfolioOpt_CW
Portfolio Optimization for CW

## Resources

1. mean variance optimization is the algorthm we are trying to implement, more specifically **resampled mean variance optimization**. 
This algorthm comes from portfolio theory, developed by Markowitz.
2. Using python package pyPortfolioOpt; https://pypi.org/project/pyportfolioopt/ 
3. Backtesting using **Zipline**; https://www.zipline.io/. This is for testing our algorithm on past hisortical data (simulated run).
